### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ <!--, General Kenobi -->, I am Pyxxil (/Josh)

I am an Honours Graduate from the University of Auckland, Majoring in Computer Science. I spend a lot of my free time working on my solo projects, which you can find either on my GitHub, under my [Organisation](https://github.com/Pyxxilated-Studios), or on my [Gitlab Profile](https://gitlab.com/Pyxxil). I also host most of my projects on my [website](https://www.pyxxilated.studio) if you'd like to play around with them. When I'm not programming, you'll probably find me at my job (mostly joking -- I do RPA, which is basically advanced Scratch), or tweaking my home server for personal use and fun.

As you can see in the above, I don't overly focus on one language, but just having fun solving problems, and making some cool software along the way.

I spend a fair amount of time working on my [website](https://www.pyxxilated.studio), which I use to host many of my own projects. I often spend time trying to optimise it for a lot of things, and Google's PageSpeed Insights is something I'm trying my best to 100% (almost there..).

Here are the current insights for my page (inspired by https://github.com/ankurparihar/readme-pagespeed-insights, however I rewrote it to work on a cloudflare worker just to learn how those worked):
